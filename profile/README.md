> # Open-SDI materials

**Open-SDI Community actively contributes to mobility-specific infrastructure technology advancement in response to the H/W aware support requirements of various mobility devices(SDV, UAM, Robot, etc.) in the future mobility society.** 
and we share documentation outputs throughout the development process, fostering a collaborative ecosystem for continuous innovation in software-defined infrastructure(SDI) technology.

From 2024 to 2027, **Open-SDI community will conduct research and development through a pipeline(development, implementation, operation, integration, and application) of software-defined infrastructure technology.**

We hope that this technology will facilitate distributed intelligent services among various future mobility devices, aiding the advancement towards a future mobility society.

> # Challenges
1. SDI may deliver effective, large-scale mobility services by segmenting AI applications through SDI platforms
2. SDI may perform an independent IaC process to respond to collaborative scenarios for real-time and dynamically changing devices
3. SDI may distribute and execute device-infrastructure code that is the result of the IaC process in conjunction with device-edge-cloud
